## Instructions
Please complete this exercise in this .Rmd document, as a group.

## The `sin.period()` function

``` {r sinperiod}

sin.period <- function(period) {
  xvals <- seq(from=0, to=2*pi, length=100)
  yvals <- sin(xvals/period)
  plot(x=xvals,
       y=yvals,
       type="l",
       lty=1,
       xaxs="i",
       lwd=2)
}

sin.period(period=1)

```

# Question 1
Take a screenshot of the code above and use the image editor program of your choice (e.g., MS Paint, PPT, Word, etc.) to label the following components of the function:

- name of function
- arguments of function
- start of the function
- R commands which can include calls to other functions
- calling the function
- passing values to the function arguments

Use Rmarkdown to insert your annotated image into this document.

# Question 2
Please describe what this `sin.period()` function does.
- Sin.period plots a sine graph. It sets hard-coded x-axis values, and the y values are adjusted based on the argument 'period' fed into the function by dividing the x-values by 'period'. Plot is used to produce the graph based off these x and y values.

## Modifying `sin.period()`
# Question 3
Modify the `sin.period()` function above to:

- have an argument `p` that is a vector of periods 
- plots for each element of `p` the function sin(x/p) where p is the period and x ranges from 0 to 2*pi

``` {r modify}

sin.period_kl <- function(p) {
  xvals <- seq(from=0, to=2*pi, length=100)
  for(i in 1:length(p)){
  yvals <- sin(xvals/p[i])
  tmp <- plot(x=xvals,
       y=yvals,
       type="l",
       lty=1,
       xaxs="i",
       lwd=2)
  }
}

rezz <- sin.period_kl(p=1:5)

```

**If you finish early, try to make the function as general as possible.**

## Creating a multi-plot
# Question 4
Use the call `par(mfrow=c(3,3))` to create 9 subplots and run your function for `p <- c(0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5)`

``` {r multiplot}
p <- c(0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5)
par(mfrow=c(3,3))
sin.period_kl(p=p)
```
